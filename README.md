# How to run it and stuff
clone the repo
Install python 3.6 through google
install flask by using pip install flask (or "python -m pip install flask" if that doesnt work )
install wtforms using pip install wtforms (same as above)
then go into your cloned repo
for macs you need to use export instead of set.
run the commands "set FLASK_APP=app.py"
and "set FLASK_DEBUG=1"

then the command "flask run" should start the server at localhost:5000
